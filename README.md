ASSIGNMENT REFLECTION:

I achieved all the basic requirements. I implemented a header, nav, and image tags with the appropriate src file paths so they could show on my project. I used what I learned about CSS to layout the website to match the requirements. I had trouble with the positioning of the nav tags; they would not go the way I wanted them to. It turned out I incorrectly positioned the align-items tag as flex-end and not center.

I achieved some of the stretch requirements,Â  made a back to the top button, added a hover effect, and added smooth scrolling. The back to the top button was implemented into the read more buttons and the home and about buttons in the header.

I had trouble adding background music to my website; Github just would not let me have audio files in my repo because they were too big (the audio file was 3 MB). The audio would play on my local build of the page but not on the github page. I provided the links I followed for the code at the top of the page, and I also left the code in for you to see. If I could receive feedback on how I could get it to work, it would be great.

I was nervous at the start of the assignment because I needed to use what I learned that week and was worried that I'd forget some of the things. As I was writing the code, I surprised myself because I felt so comfortable writing it. If I could receive feedback on my code, that would be great. :D
